# Fresh Keja UX Design Recommendations

## Service Structure

Fresh Keja offers two distinct services:
1. **Laundry Services** - Washing, drying, folding
2. **House Cleaning** - Vacuuming, seat cleaning, general cleaning

## Laundry Quantity Selection - Best Practices

### Recommended Approach: **Dual Input Method with Smart Defaults**

**Primary Method: Item Count (Recommended)**
- Users think in terms of items: "I have 5 shirts, 3 pants, 2 pairs of shoes"
- More intuitive and relatable
- Easier to visualize
- Better for pricing transparency

**Secondary Method: Weight (kg)**
- Useful for bulk laundry
- Better for commercial/industrial use
- Alternative for users who prefer it

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Default to Item Count** - Most users think this way
2. **Tab/Segment Control** - Easy switch between methods
3. **Visual Feedback** - Show estimated weight as items are added
4. **Categorized Items**:
   - Clothes (shirts, pants, dresses, etc.)
   - Shoes
   - Bedding (sheets, blankets)
   - Towels
   - Other items

5. **Smart Pricing** - Show price estimate in real-time
6. **Bulk Option** - "I have a lot" quick button for heavy users

### Why This Approach?

- **Cognitive Load**: Item count is more natural than weight estimation
- **Trust**: Users can verify their count, not guess weight
- **Flexibility**: Power users can use weight for bulk
- **Transparency**: Clear pricing per item type

## House Cleaning Service

Separate from laundry, includes:
- Vacuuming
- Seat cleaning
- General house cleaning
- Deep cleaning options

Should have its own service selection interface with:
- Room selection
- Service type checkboxes
- Frequency options (one-time, weekly, monthly)
